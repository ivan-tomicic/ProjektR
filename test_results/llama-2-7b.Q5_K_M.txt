Can I use any official reminders during the exam or laboratory exercises?
    No, you can't use them in exams or laboratory exercises.

    The official reminder is a tool for teachers to help students learn the material.
    It is not allowed to use it during an exam or laboratory exercise because it would be unfair to other students who do not have access to this information.
    If you want to use them in exams, then you should ask your teacher if they are allowed and how many copies of each reminder can be used per student.
