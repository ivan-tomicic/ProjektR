Give me a small snippet of code which I can use to test Edgar.
 To test the Edgar system, you can write a simple "Hello World" program in C programming language. Here's a sample code snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Save this code in a file with a .c extension (e.g., `hello_world.c`) and compile it using a compiler like `gcc`. For instance, execute: `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`. Then, run the executable `./hello_world` to see "Hello, World!" in your terminal.

This small program will help you test if the Edgar system is working correctly and allow you to familiarize yourself with the C programming language.
