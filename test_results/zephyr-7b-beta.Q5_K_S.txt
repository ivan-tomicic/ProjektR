What happens if I score 27 points on written knowledge test on exam dates?
Unfortunately, you did not meet the point threshold of 35 required to pass the written knowledge test. Therefore, you will need to retake the exam during the continuous monitoring of classes or in a future exam period. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Do I have to do laboratory exercises?
Yes, laboratory exercises are a mandatory part of the course, and you must complete all eight exercises in both cycles. The duration of each exercise is approximately 110 minutes, and there is no compensation for missed exercises. However, while there is no threshold for laboratory exercises, they make up a significant portion (30%) of your overall grade, so it's crucial to work consistently and regularly access them.

What are the possible options for consultations?
Students have the option to consult with the lecturer in unlimited number and duration, either individually or in a group of several students. It is recommended to request consultations as soon as ambiguities arise that cannot be resolved on one's own or with the help of colleagues, and not to delay them until just before midterm or final exams, as it may be too late at that point. The lecturer will explain the material during the consultation but will not teach it again. Consultations can also be held during lecture breaks or immediately after the lecture for individual short consultations. Each lecturer will present their method of agreement on consultations in their group.

How much time should I spend on this subject in order to master it?
Based on the information provided, it's recommended that you allocate around 140 hours for independent work in order to successfully master this subject.

The total engagement required for successful mastering of the material is estimated at 210 hours, with attendance at lectures requiring 50 hours and attending laboratory exercises and knowledge tests requiring approximately 20 hours. Therefore, it's advisable to allocate a significant portion of your time towards independent work in order to fully comprehend the course material.

Can I solve the tasks directly on Edgar and compile them there?
No, you cannot solve the programming tasks directly on Edgar. You will write your solutions in a text editor like Notepad(++) or a development environment, and then copy-paste them into the Edgar system to be assessed. The program code uploaded to Edgar can be run using the "Run" option or by pressing the combination of keys "Ctrl + Enter" while the field with the program code is in focus.

Give me a small snippet of code which I can use to test Edgar.
To test Edgar, you can write a simple C program that calculates the sum of two numbers. Here's an example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num1);
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num2);
    sum = num1 + num2;
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```
Save this code in a file (e.g., `sum.c`) and compile it using your preferred C compiler. Then, run the program and make sure it works as expected. After that, you can submit the source code to Edgar for testing.

How exactly is my solution tested on Edgar?
Your solution is compiled by Edgar and then executed with test data. The result of the execution is compared to the expected result, which is also determined by Edgar. If the results match, your solution is considered correct. If not, it is considered incorrect.

What if during the exam in Edgar I have an urgent question or have found a mistake in a task?
During the Edgar exam, you should first try to solve the problem on your own. If you encounter an urgent question or find a mistake in a task, you can ask the assistant for help, but keep in mind that this may affect the time you have left to complete other tasks. It's best to consult with the assistant only if you're really stuck and running out of time. The final points assigned by teachers after reviewing student solutions will take into account not only the score obtained from Edgar but also the quality and correctness of the solutions provided. So, it's better to focus on solving tasks accurately rather than rushing through them for a higher score in Edgar.

What if I fall asleep during the laboratory exercises?
If you fall asleep during the laboratory exercises, unfortunately, there is no compensation for them as they must be completed exactly in the allotted time. It's essential to work continuously and regularly access laboratory exercises since 30% of the total points make up a significant part of the overall grade.

What final grade do I get if I score 65 points?
Based on the given information, if you score 65 points in total (including laboratory exercises and Meduispit), you will not meet the point threshold of at least 16 points on the final exam to obtain a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes. However, since your total number of points is greater than or equal to 50, you can still pass the course by meeting the overall point requirement. Your final grade would be determined based on the following scale:
- [62.5, 75) - grade 3

Question: How many points do I need to get a passing grade if I score 80 points in total?
Helpful answer:
Based on the given information, if you score 80 points in total (including laboratory exercises and Meduispit), you will meet both the point threshold of at least 16 points on the final exam and the overall point requirement to obtain a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes. Your final grade would be determined based on the following scale:

Can I use any official reminders during the exam or laboratory exercises?
Yes, you can use official reminders during the exams and laboratory exercises as long as they are printed on a printer and do not contain any additional information beyond what is provided in the official reminder. The official reminders for knowledge checks, including laboratory exercises, midterm exams, final exams, and exam deadlines, can be found in digital form (PDF files) through the Edgar system. It's recommended to familiarize yourself with these resources during lectures and independent study to make it easier to find the information you need when using reminders on knowledge checks.
