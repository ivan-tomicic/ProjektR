Konačni review:
Model uglavnom daje gramatički ispravne odgovore, međutim u gotovo svakom odgovoru krene pričati o sasvim nevezanim stvarima i često se vrti u krug ili ponavlja jedno te isto.

What are the possible options for consultations?
Consultations are possible for individual students or groups of several students. Consultation with the lecturer in your group is also possible. Individual short consultations can be held during lecture breaks or immediately after the lecture.

The lecturer will be more than happy to explain the material to you during the consultation, but will not explain it again. It is recommended to use the consultation whenever necessary. Consultation should be requested as soon as ambiguities arise that you are unable to resolve on your own or with the help of colleagues. Do not delay the consultation until just before the midterm or final exam - at that point it will most likely be too late.

How exactly is my solution tested on Edgar?
Your solution is compiled by the Edgar system using the gcc compiler, which checks the syntax of your code. If there are any errors in the syntax, you will receive an error message from the compiler.
After compiling your code without errors, the Edgar system runs a series of test cases to check if your program produces the correct output for each test case. The test cases are designed to cover different scenarios and edge cases that may arise when running your program. If any of the test cases fail, you will receive an error message indicating which test failed and why.
In summary, your solution is first compiled by the gcc compiler to check its syntax. Then, it is run against a series of test cases designed to verify that your program produces the correct output for different scenarios. If any test fails, you will receive an error message indicating which test failed and why.

What final grade do I get if I score 65 points?
You will receive a grade 3, as your total number of points is 65 which is between 50 and 62.5.

The point threshold for obtaining a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes is 16 points on the final exam. As you have scored 65 points, you have met this requirement.

The maximum number of points for laboratory exercises and the Meduispit is 30 each, but they do not have any point thresholds.

Therefore, your total number of points (65) meets the requirements for obtaining a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes. However, as you have scored below 75 points, you will receive a grade 3 instead of a grade 4.

In summary, you will receive a grade 3 for scoring 65 points.
