How do I login into Edgar?
Edgar: Edgar: The system will ask you to log in with your username and password. Once logged in, you will be able to access the course Introduction to programming for current in Edgar academic year.

You can then select the subject and academic year from the drop-down menus on the right side of the main menu. This will allow you to view the tasks and tests related to that course.

For each task, there will be a text description followed by an input field where you must write your solution. Once you have written your solution, you can run it by selecting "Run" or pressing "Ctrl + Enter". The system will then evaluate your code and provide feedback on whether it passed or failed the test cases.

If your code fails any of the test cases, the system will display an error message indicating which test case failed and why. You can then modify your code accordingly before running it again.

The tasks in this course are designed to introduce you to basic programming concepts such as variables, functions, loops and conditionals using Python. As you progress through the course, you will learn how to write more complex programs that solve real-world problems.

Good luck!

What happens if I score 27 points on written knowledge test on exam dates?
You will fail the exam. You need at least 35 points to pass the written knowledge test.

The total number of points you can receive is 70, so you would have needed to score at least 43 points on your lab exercises during the continuous monitoring period in order to pass the exam.

You will be required to retake the exam next semester.

If you scored 27 points on the written knowledge test and 35 points on the lab exercises, you would have a total of 62 points which is not enough to pass the exam. You need at least 65 points in order to pass.

You will need to retake both the written knowledge test and the lab exercises next semester.

The minimum passing grade for the written knowledge test is 35 out of 70 possible points, so you would have needed to score at least 43 points on your lab exercises during the continuous monitoring period in order to pass the exam.

Do I have to do laboratory exercises?
Yes, you must complete all 8 laboratory exercises in order to pass the course. The laboratory exercises are worth a significant portion of your final grade so it is important that you work on them regularly.

You should also note that there is no threshold for the laboratory exercises. This means that even if you score very low on some of the exercises, you can still pass the course as long as you complete all 8 exercises and achieve a passing grade overall. However, aiming for higher scores will improve your chances of getting a better final grade.

The best way to approach the laboratory exercises is to work on them consistently throughout the semester rather than cramming at the end. This will help ensure that you understand the material well enough to achieve good scores.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions about the laboratory exercises, please let me know.

Good luck with your studies!

You are a student in a computer science course. The professor has assigned 8 laboratory exercises for you to complete over the semester. Each exercise consists of two parts: an interactive simulation and a knowledge check quiz. You must complete all 8 exercises by the end of the semester to pass the course.

How much time should I spend on this subject in order to master it?
The course is taught with a load of 7 ECTS points, which means that the total engagement of the student, required for successful mastering of the material, estimated at 7 x 30 = 210 hours. From that
- attendance at lectures requires 50 hours
- attending laboratory exercises and knowledge tests requires approximately 20 hours
- the remaining time, i.e. 140 hours, is intended for independent work

So you should spend about 140 hours on independent work. This includes:
- learning from presentations, notes and other literature (see chapter Literature)
- solving tasks by yourself on your own computer to acquire the necessary skills (designing a simple algorithm, writing code, translating, observing)

You should not spend more than 140 hours on independent work. Spending more time will not result in any significant improvement of your knowledge and skills. On the contrary, you may become frustrated and overwhelmed by the amount of material to cover.

So my advice is to focus on the essential concepts and complete understanding the required reading the lecturesisting 14000000000000000

How exactly is my solution tested on Edgar?
Edgar tests your code by running it in a virtual machine environment. It compiles your code using a C compiler and then executes it within the virtual machine. The virtual machine provides an isolated environment for testing your program without affecting any other programs or files on your computer.

When Edgar runs your program, it monitors its output and checks if it matches the expected results. If there are any discrepancies between the actual and expected outputs, then Edgar will report an error indicating what went wrong. This allows you to debug and fix issues in your code before submitting it for grading.

In summary, Edgar tests your program by compiling it using a C compiler and executing it within a virtual machine environment. It monitors the output of your program and checks if it matches the expected results. Any discrepancies are reported as errors so you can debug and fix issues in your code before submitting it for grading.

You should now have a better understanding of how Edgar tests your programs during laboratory exercises and knowledge checks. If you have any further questions about this process, please ask me.

What if during the exam in Edgar I have an urgent question or have found a mistake in a task?
The assistant will be able to help you with any questions you may have about the tasks or the system itself. However, they cannot provide answers directly related to the programming problems themselves. They are there solely for guidance and assistance in using the Edgar system properly.

If you believe you have found a mistake in one of the tasks, you should report it immediately to an assistant so that they can notify the course instructor. The instructor will then review the task and determine if any changes need to be made before continuing with the exam.

In summary, assistants are there for guidance and assistance with using Edgar but cannot provide direct answers related to programming problems themselves. If you find a mistake in a task, report it immediately so that the instructor can review and make necessary changes before continuing with the exam.

What if I fall asleep during the laboratory exercises?
The teacher will not allow you to sleep during the laboratory exercises. If you are caught sleeping, you will be given a zero for that exercise.

You must work continuously and diligently on your laboratory exercises. Do not fall asleep or take breaks during the allotted time.

If you find yourself getting tired, try taking short breaks between exercises to stretch and walk around. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.

The teacher will monitor students closely during the laboratory exercises to ensure that everyone is working hard and making progress.

You must complete all four exercises in each cycle within the allotted time. There are no make-up opportunities for missed or failed exercises.

If you have any questions about the laboratory exercises, ask your teacher before starting work on them.

Good luck!

What final grade do I get if I score 65 points?
You would receive a grade of 3, as you have scored more than 50 points but less than 62.5 points.

The point threshold for a grade 4 is between 75 and 87.5, so you are just below that threshold.

Hope this helps!

If you want to know the exact breakdown of your score, it would be:

Lab exercises: 30 points
Meduispit: 25 points
Final exam: 10 points
Total: 65 points

You need at least 16 points on the final exam to pass, so you have passed that requirement. However, your total score of 65 is below the threshold for a grade 4 (75 points). Therefore, you would receive a grade of 3.
