What are the possible options for consultations?
Students who regularly attend lectures have the option of consulting in an unlimited number and duration. Consultations can be requested individually or as a group, and it is recommended to use them whenever necessary. The lecturer will explain the material during the consultation but will not teach it again. It is best to request consultations as soon as ambiguities arise that cannot be resolved on your own or with the help of colleagues. Delaying consultations until just before midterm or final exams may be too late. Each lecturer will present their method for agreeing on consultations in their group, and individual short consultations can also be held during lecture breaks or immediately after the lecture.
