What happens if I score 27 points on written knowledge test on exam dates?
Unfortunately, you did not meet the point threshold of 35 required to pass the written knowledge test. Therefore, your overall grade for the exam period will be based solely on the points earned in laboratory exercises during continuous monitoring of classes. The total number of points received by adding up the points obtained in laboratory exercises during continuous monitoring of classes is called transferred number of lab points. Your overall grade for the exam period will depend on whether this transferred number of lab points meets or exceeds the passing grade requirement.

Do I have to do laboratory exercises?
Yes, you have to complete all eight laboratory exercises as they are a significant part of your overall grade. It's essential to work consistently and regularly access them since no threshold is prescribed for the laboratory exercises, but 30% of the total points make up a considerable portion of the overall grade. Additionally, each laboratory exercise lasts approximately 110 minutes, and there is no compensation for missed exercises. The laboratory exercises consist of two parts, and you must complete them precisely in the allotted time during the laboratory sessions.

What are the possible options for consultations?
Students who attend lectures regularly have the option of unlimited consultations with the lecturer. Consultations can be requested individually or in groups, and it is recommended to use them whenever necessary. It's best to request a consultation as soon as ambiguities arise that you are unable to resolve on your own or with the help of colleagues. Delaying the consultation until just before midterm or final exams may be too late. The lecturer will explain the material during the consultation, but will not teach it again. Consultations can take place during lecture breaks or immediately after the lecture, and each lecturer will present their method for agreeing on consultations in their group.

Can I solve the tasks directly on Edgar and compile them there?
No, you cannot solve the programming tasks directly on Edgar. You need to write your solutions in a separate text editor (such as Notepad++ or any other development environment) and then copy-paste them into the Edgar system to run and test them. The Edgar system is used for automatic assessment of tests, not for coding and compiling programs.

Give me a small snippet of code which I can use to test Edgar.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    printf("The value of x is: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```
This code prints the value of a variable `x` to the console using the `printf` function. It's a simple program that you can use to test your Edgar installation by saving it as a .c file and running it in a C compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks, Eclipse CDT, or Visual Studio Code. After running the program, you should see the output "The value of x is: 5" printed to the console.

How exactly is my solution tested on Edgar?
Your solution is compiled by Edgar and then executed with test data. The result of execution is compared to the expected result, which is also determined by Edgar. If the results match, your solution is considered correct. If not, it is considered incorrect.

What if during the exam in Edgar I have an urgent question or have found a mistake in a task?
During the Edgar exam, you should first try to solve the problem on your own. If you encounter an urgent question or find a mistake in a task, you can consult the assistant who is supervising the exam. They will provide guidance and clarify any doubts you may have. However, it's important to remember that the Edgar system automatically scores the tests, but the final points are assigned by teachers after reviewing student solutions. So, while the Edgar system provides immediate feedback, it's still necessary to submit your completed assignments for teacher evaluation. Additionally, there is no compensation for mid-term and final exams in case of absence. Students who fail to pass the course during the continuous monitoring of classes can take the exam dates provided by the university.

What if I fall asleep during the laboratory exercises?
If you fall asleep during the laboratory exercises, unfortunately, there is no compensation for them as the duration of one laboratory exercise is approximately 110 minutes, and there is no threshold prescribed for these exercises. It's essential to work continuously and regularly access laboratory exercises because 30% of the total points make up a significant part of the overall grade. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that you are well-rested before starting the laboratory exercises.

What final grade do I get if I score 65 points?
Based on continuous monitoring of classes, you would receive a grade of 3 since your total number of points is less than 50 (45/90). However, at the exam period, you would receive a grade of 2 since your score of 65 is below the point threshold of 16 for passing on the final exam.

Can I use any official reminders during the exam or laboratory exercises?
Yes, you can use official reminders during the exams and laboratory exercises as long as they are printed on a printer and do not contain any additional information beyond what is provided in the official reminder. The official reminders for C programming language, midterm exam, final exam, and exam deadlines can be found in digital form (pdf file) through the Edgar system. It's recommended to familiarize yourself with these resources during lectures and independent work to facilitate their use during knowledge checks. However, it's important not to add anything to the laboratory exercises when using official reminders.
