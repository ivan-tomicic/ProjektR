If the program consists of files (modules) e.g. p1.c, p2.c i p3.c, in tasks.json, in line\n\"args\": [\"-g\", \"-std=c11\", \"-pedantic-errors\",\n \"-Wall\", \"-o\",  \"program.exe\", \"${file}\"]\n\"${file}\" shoud be replaced with list of modules comprising the program:\n\"args\": [\"-g\", \"-std=c11\", \"-pedantic-errors\",\n \"-Wall\", \"-o\",  \"program.exe\", \"p1.c\", \"p2.c\", \"p3.c\"]\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that all modules listed here are compiled every timy, regardless of whether they have been modified in the meantime.\n\nConfigure the environment for complex programs using make\nUnnecessary compilations can be avoided using the program make, which utilizes executable program dependencies on object code files, and object code files on source code files. If the program detects that, for example, the source code file is newer than the object code file that depends on it, it will be compiled. Files whose source code is older than the corresponding object code will not be compiler.\nProgram make can be found in C: \\MinGW\\bin (or in the appropriate folder if MinGW is not installed with default destination) under a non-standard name mingw32-make.exe, so it is useful to copy it first to make.exe with copy\ncopy C:\\MinGW\\bin\\mingw32-make.exe C:\\MinGW\\bin\\make.exe",

In the extension search box, type C / C ++ and then select the Microsoft extension.\nAfter downloading, it is necessary to restart the VSC by pressing a button Reload.\n\nConfigure the environment for simple programs\nUnfortunately, VSC is not yet configured to compile C programs. Configuration can be done through menus, but the simplest way is to create a .vscode subfolder (note that the name begins with a dot) and in this colder, create two files written in Java Script Object Notation, JSON:\ntasks.json\tdescribes the tasks to be performed as part of the program compilation\nlaunch.json\tdescribes how to run the executable program\nFiles are created by selecting the folder within which the files should be created, selecting the appropriate icon and typing in the name of the new file.\nThe following code should be copied to the window on the right in the tasks.json file:\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [{\n        \"label\": \"Build with gcc\",\n        \"type\": \"shell\",\n        \"command\": \"gcc\",\n        \"args\": [\"-g\", \"-std=c11\", \"-pedantic-errors\",\n            \"-Wall\", \"-o\", \"program.exe\", \"${file}\"\n        ]\n    }]\n}\n\nBasically, we are creating a task that will be called Build with gcc (\"label\"), which is an operating system command (\"type\":\"Shell\"), and the specific command that is executed is gcc (\"Command\"). \"args\" is a list of arguments of an external program call. ${file} is the name of the currently open program file, so the program.c is currently open in the window, the previous description will result in the execution of the following operating system command:\ngcc -g -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall -o program.exe program.c\n\n3   Writing programs with a simple editor, compiling and executing programs\nThe whole process of writing and compiling programs will be illustrated in the command prompt, where you first need to create a folder where the program file will be stored, and then make it current e.g.\nmkdir C:\\IPRO\ncd C:\\IPRO\nand start editing program there with a text editor:\nnotepad program.c\n\nThe following code should be entered in this file:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n   printf(\"Introduction to Programming\");\n   return 0;\n}\nand save the changes via the File/Save menu or the standard keyboard shortcut Ctrl-S (press the Ctrl key and then, without releasing it, the S key). After that it is necessary to check whether elementary compilation works:\ngcc program.c -o program.exe\n\nThis simplest gcc compiler call integrates compiler and linker functions. The program.c file is compiled. Because of the -o (output) option, it creates an executable file named program.exe which can then be executed with the command\nprogram.exe\nor\nprogram\nIf an error occurred while calling the compiler or starting the program, you should look for the solution in the next section.\n\nBasically, the previous compiler call is internally executed in the same way as the following sequence:\ngcc -c program.c\ngcc program.o -o program.exe\nThe first call, because of the argument or the -c (compile) option, is just a compilation to program.o, which in this case remains stored in the current folder (in the case of an elementary call, that object code is automatically deleted). The second call links the object code with the program libraries and creates the executable program.exe.",

To prevent the window from closing immediately, a breakpoint should be placed on the last line of the program by clicking the mouse at the very beginning of the line containing the return command.\nIf a new folder is created for another program or programs, .vscode folder should be copied there and all the preparatory actions are done.\nThe basics of working with a debugger\nProgram behavior is easily monitored using debugger. To demonstrate how such a program works, we will replace the content of program.c with\n#include<stdio.h>\n\n4\tWriting and compiling programs in an integrated development environment\nKnowledge of elementary editing of a program by notepad or a similar text editor, compiling programs from the command line, and running programs from the command line, is mandatory and will be tested during laboratory exercises.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to make writing, compiling, and testing programs easier. In the Introduction to Programming course, we will use Visual Studio Code development environment, because it is an open source program, runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac), the installation package is relatively small compared to other similar environments, installation is fast and can be used for programming in any programming language, provided that a suitable compiler is installed on your computer, such as the MinGW package whose installation and use is described in the previous sections. The following assumes that MinGW is installed in accordance with the instructions in the previous sections.\nInstallation of the environment\nVisual Studio Code (VSC) is downloaded from the link\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/download\nAfter selecting the platform, downloading and running the installer and successfully completing the installation, VSC is ready to launch.\nThe VSC desktop treats a single folder within the file system as a project. Therefore, the first action to take is to open the folder in which the program files are or will be located, such as the folder where we tested the compiler gcc (File -> Open Folder...).\nThe VSC toolbar consists of the following icons:\nExplorer (work with files in the currently open folder)\nSearch (search for content in the currently open folder and subfolders)\nSource control (working with GIT version control system)\nDebug (running a program and troubleshooting a program)\nExtensions (installing a VSC extension)\n\nint main(void){\n   int i;\n   i = 0;\n   i = i + 1;\n   printf(\"Value of i: %d\\n\", i);\n   return 0;\n}\nand monitor the execution of that program step by step.\nIn short, we define one variable here, set it\u2019s initial value, increase it by 1, and finally print its final value in a window with accompanying text.\nIn the program, we first set a breakpoint at the statement where to pause the execution, by left-clicking at the very beginning of the corresponding line.\nAfter compilation, the program starts executing and then stops at the breakpoint.\nBringing the mouse cursor over a variable name gives you an insight into its value.\nRemeber definition of a variable only provides memory space, but not a default value.\nDebugger\u2019s toolbar responds with a popup window that lets you see the meaning of each icon together with the keyboard shortcut which triggers the corresponding action and contains the following commands (action names and corresponding shortcuts are listed in parentheses):\nContinue running to the end or next breakpoint (Continue, F5)\nExecute the following statement without entering the function code (Step over, F10)\nExecute the following statement entering the function code (Step into, F11)\nExit the current function (Step out, Shift-F11)\nRestart the program with recompilation (Restart, Ctrl-Shift-F5)\nStop the program (Stop, Shift-F5)\nIf the following statement is executed with the Step over action, the program stops after executing the command, and hovering over the variable name indicates that the content has changed.\nThe state of several variables in the surrounding of statement where the program stopped can be monitored in the Locals window. In larger programs, some variables that are not in immediate surrounding of the current statement may disappear from the Locals window. In such a case, the variable or expression whose value we want to watch constantly can be added to the Watch window.\n\nthat is, a known compiler call which will create program.exe.\nThe only novelty here is an option -g which adds an interaction with the debugger to the executable code.\nIt should be noted that this configuration is only good for programs that consist of a single source file, but therefore allows the same folder contain an unlimited number of such simple programs.\nThe file launch.json should be created in the same way, with the following content\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"C Launch\",\n            \"preLaunchTask\": \"Build with gcc\",\n            \"type\": \"cppdbg\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/program.exe\",\n            \"args\": [],\n            \"stopAtEntry\": false,\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n            \"environment\": [],\n            \"externalConsole\": true,\n            \"miDebuggerPath\": \"gdb.exe\",\n            \"linux\": {\n                \"MIMode\": \"gdb\"\n            },\n            \"osx\": {\n                \"MIMode\": \"lldb\"\n            },\n            \"windows\": {\n                \"MIMode\": \"gdb\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\nIn short, we have given the name of the job that must be started before our program is started (\"preLaunchTask\"), the path to our program (\"program\") and the path to the debugger(\"miDebuggerPath\").

However, you can create a generic Makefile that can be used with multiple languages by using a combination of predefined variables and conditional constructs. For example, you can define the compiler name and options in a variable like CC and CFLAGS, and then use these variables in the rules for different languages. This way, you can create a single Makefile that can be used to build programs written in various programming languages.",

After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\nAfter the 10-minute period from the submission of the test, the review will be disabled, but the summary status of the test will still be displayed.\n\nAn overview of the summary results of all tests performed so far can be obtained at any time by selecting the option \u201eMy previous exams\u201c.\n\n\n3\tTicketing system\nIn order to facilitate communication between students and teaching staff during the writing of tests, Edgar offers a support system called Ticketing system. In case of doubt about the accuracy of the solution or something else, the student can ask a question related to a specific task.\nUsing the system while writing the test is described below.\n\t1. Click on the \"yellow tools\" icon  in the upper right corner of the question page\n\t2. Enter a description of the problem in the window that appears and confirm it by clicking Yes, raise ticket. Then continue with the test,  without waiting for an answer.\n\t3.The teaching staff will examine the problem as soon as possible and answer the student. While waiting for an answer, the student is not able to send additional messages related to the same task (he can send messages about other tasks) - the icon turns red, and an hourglass icon appears next to it.\nAfter the the problem has been addresses, a message saying \"Ticket resolved\" appears on the student's screen.\n\t4. The student can then return to the appropriate question and check for the answer. The answer can be viewed by clicking on the \"green cloud\" icon. Remark: Only after the teaching staff answers the question related to the task, the student can ask the next question about the same task if necessary.\n\n2.2\tIndependent work\nThe course is performed with a load of 7 ECTS credits, which means that the total student engagement required to successfully master the material is estimated at approximately 7 x 30 = 210 hours. It is envisaged that:\n    50 hours will be spent on attending classes,\n    20 hours will be spent participating in laboratory exercises and attending exams,\n    the remaining time, i.e. at least 140 hours, must be spent on independent work.\nIt should be noted that 140 hours, when distributed on all teaching weeks, equal to an average of approximately 10 hours of independent work per week. Due to the layered approach in the processing of materials, it is very important to work continuously, every week. Campaign work (e.g. \"I won\u2019t do anything for three weeks and then I\u2019ll make up for it all at once\") on this subject will almost certainly end in very poor results.\nIndependent work includes:\n    Learning\n        Slides from the lectures\n        Your own notes\n        Reading other literature (see chapter Recommended reading)\n        Internet\n    Solving tasks\n        solving a large number of tasks on your own computer acquires the necessary skills (simple algorithm design, code writing, translation, error detection, testing) which are tested in laboratory exercises and written tests (midterm, final exam, exam).\n        It is therefore of the utmost importance:\n        solve published assignments for exercises in addition to lectures (published at the same time as lectures)\n        test examples of programs and excerpts from lectures, modify these examples yourself, notice the effects of modifications (you can copy the program code of examples from lectures from PDF versions of published lectures)\n    Reading other literature (see chapter Other materials - Recommended reading)\n    Browsing content on the Internet for additional explanations and examples",

The course material is designed to be processed in a layered approach, with each layer building on the previous ones.

Ing., melita.fertalj@fer.hr\nIf communicating via email, please start subject with [IPRO2023].\n\nThe following editors (in addition to Visual Studio Code) are allowed in lab: Notepad and Notepad++. \nNotepad can be run in two ways:\n\u00a8 by specifying only the command notepad,\n\u00a8 by specifying the command notepad followed by the name of the file to be edited (notepad file_name).\nThe same applies to the Notepad ++ editor, but assuming that the folder where Notepad ++ is installed is added to the system variable path (like for gcc, see Instructions For Writing Programs):\n\u00a8 by specifying only the command notepad++,\n\u00a8 by specifying the command notepad++ followed by the name of the file to be edited (notepad++ file_name).\nIf the editor is started without a file name, the file name in which you want to save the typed text will be specified later. However, as txt is the default extension for the file name, it often happens that the file gets an additional txt extension, and care should be taken with the folder in which it will be located. For example, if a file needs to be named ipro.c, it is possible that it should actually be named ipro.c.txt. Therefore, it is recommended to start the editor by specifying the file name (with the possibility of specifying the absolute or relative path):\nnotepad ipro.c\t(the editor opens the ipro.c file located in the working folder)\nnotepad d:\\exercises\\p.c\t(the editor opens the p.c file located in the folder \\exercises on disk D)",

A correct answer obtains positive points, an incorrect answer obtains negative points. An unanswered question does not earn negative points.\n        creation of one or more programs (algorithm design, coding, testing). In these assignments there are no negative points.\nEach student works independently on the faculty computer, but under the supervision of the teachers on duty. The student has at his disposal the same tools that he uses to solve tasks on his own computer:\n    Notepad and Notepad++ editors, gcc compiler used via command line of the operating system\n    VSCode development environment\nIMPORTANT: regardless of which of the options the student chooses, knowledge of elementary program editing with the Notepad/Notepad++ editor, as well as compiling and running the program from the command line is mandatory!\nLaboratory exercise includes the development of one or more programs (algorithm design, coding, testing). The exact schedule by dates, topics and number of program tasks per exercise, and the maximum number of points that can be obtained in each exercise will be published on time, at least a week before the exercises, on Teams. Students will submit solutions to their tasks during laboratory exercises via the Edgar system. Instructions for that will be available on time.",

The student has at his disposal the same tools that he uses to solve tasks on his own computer:\n    Notepad and Notepad++ editors, gcc compiler used via command line of the operating system\n    VSCode development environment\nIMPORTANT: regardless of which of the options the student chooses, knowledge of elementary program editing with the Notepad/Notepad++ editor, as well as compiling and running the program from the command line is mandatory!\nLaboratory exercise includes the development of one or more programs (algorithm design, coding, testing). The exact schedule by dates, topics and number of program tasks per exercise, and the maximum number of points that can be obtained in each exercise will be published on time, at least a week before the exercises, on Teams. Students will submit solutions to their tasks during laboratory exercises via the Edgar system. Instructions for that will be available on time.\n\n2.2\tIndependent work\nThe course is performed with a load of 7 ECTS credits, which means that the total student engagement required to successfully master the material is estimated at approximately 7 x 30 = 210 hours. It is envisaged that:\n    50 hours will be spent on attending classes,\n    20 hours will be spent participating in laboratory exercises and attending exams,\n    the remaining time, i.e. at least 140 hours, must be spent on independent work.\nIt should be noted that 140 hours, when distributed on all teaching weeks, equal to an average of approximately 10 hours of independent work per week. Due to the layered approach in the processing of materials, it is very important to work continuously, every week. Campaign work (e.g. \"I won\u2019t do anything for three weeks and then I\u2019ll make up for it all at once\") on this subject will almost certainly end in very poor results.\nIndependent work includes:\n    Learning\n        Slides from the lectures\n        Your own notes\n        Reading other literature (see chapter Recommended reading)\n        Internet\n    Solving tasks\n        solving a large number of tasks on your own computer acquires the necessary skills (simple algorithm design, code writing, translation, error detection, testing) which are tested in laboratory exercises and written tests (midterm, final exam, exam).\n        It is therefore of the utmost importance:\n        solve published assignments for exercises in addition to lectures (published at the same time as lectures)\n        test examples of programs and excerpts from lectures, modify these examples yourself, notice the effects of modifications (you can copy the program code of examples from lectures from PDF versions of published lectures)\n    Reading other literature (see chapter Other materials - Recommended reading)\n    Browsing content on the Internet for additional explanations and examples",

After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\n2.4\tConsultations\nStudents have the opportunity to consult with the teacher. Consultations will take place through the MS Teams platform, at times agreed with the teacher.\n    the teacher will be happy to additionally explain the material to you during the consultation, but will not teach it again\n    consultation should be requested as soon as ambiguities arise that you are unable to resolve on your own or with the help of colleagues. Do not postpone the consultation until just before the midterm exam, final exam or exam - at that point it will most likely be too late.\n\n2.5\tKnowledge tests\nDuring the continuous assessment process, two written exams are taken: midterm exam and final exam.\n    exact time is TBD\n    part of the tasks can be in the form of questions, part of the tasks can be based on choosing the correct answer, but most of the tasks are related to solving a given problem in the programming language C.\n    tasks are solved on a computer at FER\n    exams are graded by Edgar, but these points do not have to be final; final points are assigned by teachers after reviewing student solutions\n    there is no compensation for midterm exams and final exams in case of absence\nStudents who fail to pass the course during the continuous monitoring of classes, can take one or more classical exams.\n    exact time is TBD\n    classical exams are similar to the midterm exam and the final exam, but, as a rule, are more extensive\n\n\n3\tConditions for obtaining a passing grade\n3.1\tDuring the continuous assessment\nThe total number of points gained during the continuous assessment is obtained by adding the points gained at lectures, points gained in laboratory exercises and points gained in the midterm exam and the final exam:\n    total number of points = number of points at lectures + number of lab points + number of points on intermediate exam + number of points on final exam\n\nAfter the 10-minute period from the submission of the test, the review will be disabled, but the summary status of the test will still be displayed.\n\nAn overview of the summary results of all tests performed so far can be obtained at any time by selecting the option \u201eMy previous exams\u201c.\n\n\n3\tTicketing system\nIn order to facilitate communication between students and teaching staff during the writing of tests, Edgar offers a support system called Ticketing system. In case of doubt about the accuracy of the solution or something else, the student can ask a question related to a specific task.\nUsing the system while writing the test is described below.\n\t1. Click on the \"yellow tools\" icon  in the upper right corner of the question page\n\t2. Enter a description of the problem in the window that appears and confirm it by clicking Yes, raise ticket. Then continue with the test,  without waiting for an answer.\n\t3.The teaching staff will examine the problem as soon as possible and answer the student. While waiting for an answer, the student is not able to send additional messages related to the same task (he can send messages about other tasks) - the icon turns red, and an hourglass icon appears next to it.\nAfter the the problem has been addresses, a message saying \"Ticket resolved\" appears on the student's screen.\n\t4. The student can then return to the appropriate question and check for the answer. The answer can be viewed by clicking on the \"green cloud\" icon. Remark: Only after the teaching staff answers the question related to the task, the student can ask the next question about the same task if necessary.",

In case of doubt about the accuracy of the solution or something else, the student can ask a question related to a specific task.\nUsing the system while writing the test is described below.\n\t1. Click on the \"yellow tools\" icon  in the upper right corner of the question page\n\t2. Enter a description of the problem in the window that appears and confirm it by clicking Yes, raise ticket. Then continue with the test,  without waiting for an answer.\n\t3.The teaching staff will examine the problem as soon as possible and answer the student. While waiting for an answer, the student is not able to send additional messages related to the same task (he can send messages about other tasks) - the icon turns red, and an hourglass icon appears next to it.\nAfter the the problem has been addresses, a message saying \"Ticket resolved\" appears on the student's screen.\n\t4. The student can then return to the appropriate question and check for the answer. The answer can be viewed by clicking on the \"green cloud\" icon. Remark: Only after the teaching staff answers the question related to the task, the student can ask the next question about the same task if necessary.\n\nWith each task, information is shown regarding the points that the student earns for correct, unanswered and incorrect answer.\n\nIn the upper right corner there is a clock that counts down the time until the end of writing the test, a picture of the student and the \"Submit\" button which is used to submit the entire test for the final assessment (not individual tasks!).\n\nThe student is obliged to submit the test for assessment by the end of the countdown, but it will be possible to submit the test for assessment in a reasonable time after the expiration. This timeout, however, will be recorded in the system, so the test can be canceled later.\nIn the upper left corner (next to the test name) there is a button for selecting the layout of the screen.\n\n\n2.1\tTests with program tasks \nImportant: The program task must first be prepared and tested outside Edgar. This means that before submitting a solution to the Edgar system, the program needs to be written (eg with the Notepad/++ editor or in the VSC), compiled (by calling the gcc compiler), all errors and warnings must be resolved, and the program should be thoroughly tested by executing against different test data. Only when you consider your solution to be entirely correct, you should copy-paste the code into Edgar.\nIn tasks that require writing of a program, in the Edgar system, below the text of the task, there is a field to which the solution (program code) should be pasted. \nThe program code transferred to the Edgar system can be run in the following ways:\n\u2022\tby selecting the option \u201eRun\u201c\n\u2022\twhile the program code field is in focus (the mouse pointer is in the field), by a key combination Ctrl + Enter\n\nIf errors or warnings occur during the compilation of the source code, the error/warning reported by the gcc compiler is shown.\n\n2.4\tConsultations\nStudents have the opportunity to consult with the teacher. Consultations will take place through the MS Teams platform, at times agreed with the teacher.\n    the teacher will be happy to additionally explain the material to you during the consultation, but will not teach it again\n    consultation should be requested as soon as ambiguities arise that you are unable to resolve on your own or with the help of colleagues. Do not postpone the consultation until just before the midterm exam, final exam or exam - at that point it will most likely be too late.\n\n2.5\tKnowledge tests\nDuring the continuous assessment process, two written exams are taken: midterm exam and final exam.\n    exact time is TBD\n    part of the tasks can be in the form of questions, part of the tasks can be based on choosing the correct answer, but most of the tasks are related to solving a given problem in the programming language C.\n    tasks are solved on a computer at FER\n    exams are graded by Edgar, but these points do not have to be final; final points are assigned by teachers after reviewing student solutions\n    there is no compensation for midterm exams and final exams in case of absence\nStudents who fail to pass the course during the continuous monitoring of classes, can take one or more classical exams.\n    exact time is TBD\n    classical exams are similar to the midterm exam and the final exam, but, as a rule, are more extensive\n\n\n3\tConditions for obtaining a passing grade\n3.1\tDuring the continuous assessment\nThe total number of points gained during the continuous assessment is obtained by adding the points gained at lectures, points gained in laboratory exercises and points gained in the midterm exam and the final exam:\n    total number of points = number of points at lectures + number of lab points + number of points on intermediate exam + number of points on final exam\n\nOnly if the print statement is corrected to \nprintf(\"%d %d\\n%d\", a, b, a + b);\n\nthe program will return the correct result for all test cases.\n\nIn the event of an unforeseen circumstance (eg power failure), Edgar allows the current contents of the solution field to be stored:\n\u2022\tExplicitly - the contents of the field can be explicitly saved by clicking the \"Save\" button in the upper right corner (below the \"Run\" button).\n\u2022\tImplicitly - Edgar automatically saves the contents of the field each time it is started with the \"Run\" option. Therefore, \"Save\" should only be used if you have written program code and have not run it.\nIf an interrupt occurs, the test can later be re-accessed. By selecting the option \"Start exam (or continue ongoing exam)\" from the main menu, the system will display all tests that you have started but have not submitted, as well as the due time for the completion of the test (Available until). By entering the appropriate password, work on the interrupted test continues.\n\n\n2.2\tCompletion of writing and submission of the test for assessment \nAfter completing all the tasks, the test should be submitted for the final assessment by selecting the \"Submit\" option in the upper right corner of the window. The submission is confirmed once again by selecting \"Yes, submit test!\", but can also be canceled by selecting \"No, continue writing\". Also, the screen will show your solutions to individual tasks, which should be visually inspected before final submission.\nThen it is necessary to wait for the completion of the evaluation.\n\nAfter the evaluation, the summary results of the test will be displayed. Within 10 minutes of submission, the system provides an overview of the assessment of individual tasks. The overview of individual tasks is accessed by selecting the option \u201eReview\u201c.\n\nAfter the 10-minute period from the submission of the test, the review will be disabled, but the summary status of the test will still be displayed.",
