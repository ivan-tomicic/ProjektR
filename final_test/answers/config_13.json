Install the VSCode extension for your preferred debugging tool (e.g., Chrome Debugger or Node.js Debugger).\n2. Open the folder containing your code in VSCode.\n3. Create a launch configuration by clicking on the \"Debug\" icon in the activity bar, then selecting \"Add Configuration...\" and filling out the required fields.\n4. Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left gutter (margin) next to each line where you want the debugger to pause execution.\n5. Start the debugging session by clicking on the \"Debug\" icon or pressing F5. The debugger will now pause at the first breakpoint and allow you to step through your code, inspect variables, and view call stacks.",
