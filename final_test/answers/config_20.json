Change directory to the folder containing your source code file. For example, if your source code is in a file named \"program.c\" in the \"ipro\" folder, type: cd ipro\n2. Use the gcc compiler to translate the program into an executable file. For example, if you want to compile \"program.c\" into an executable file named \"program.exe\", type: gcc -o program.exe program.c\n3. To execute the translated program, simply type its name followed by any necessary arguments in a new command line. For example, if your program takes two integers as input and prints the larger one, you might type: ./program.exe 10 5\n4. The output will be displayed on the terminal (or command prompt) screen. If you want to redirect the output to a file, use a redirection operator like this: ./program.exe 10 5 > output.txt\n5. To exit the program, press Ctrl+C or type \"exit\" in the command line",

Configuration can be done through menus, but the simplest way is to create a .vscode subfolder (note that the name begins with a dot) and in this colder, create two files written in Java Script Object Notation, JSON:\ntasks.json\tdescribes the tasks to be performed as part of the program compilation\nlaunch.json\tdescribes how to run the executable program\nFiles are created by selecting the folder within which the files should be created, selecting the appropriate icon and typing in the name of the new file.\nThe following code should be copied to the window on the right in the tasks.json file:\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [{\n        \"label\": \"Build with gcc\",\n        \"type\": \"shell\",\n        \"command\": \"gcc\",\n        \"args\": [\"-g\", \"-std=c11\", \"-pedantic-errors\",\n            \"-Wall\", \"-o\", \"program.exe\", \"${file}\"\n        ]\n    }]\n}\n\nBasically, we are creating a task that will be called Build with gcc (\"label\"), which is an operating system command (\"type\":\"Shell\"), and the specific command that is executed is gcc (\"Command\"). \"args\" is a list of arguments of an external program call. ${file} is the name of the currently open program file, so the program.c is currently open in the window, the previous description will result in the execution of the following operating system command:\ngcc -g -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall -o program.exe program.c\n\nIn the above configuration(\"miDebuggerPath\") it is understood that system variable Path contains the folder in which debugger gdb.exe is installed. If this is not the case, the correct absolute path to the file gdb.exe must be entered.\nNow all we have to do is open our source program file (because the configuration specifies that the program currently open in the editor is compiled) select Debug and start the program by pressing Start debugger or simply by pressing the key F5 on the keyboard.\nConsequently, the program will be compiled as described in prelaunch task in tasks.json and then, if compilation is successful, the program will be executed described in launch.json.\nIf the program has been modified in any way in the meantime, mark x after the program name will change into a circle and changes will need to be saved before the compilation with File/Save or Ctrl-S.\nThis action will print the text Introduction to Programming in a new window, which will then close immediately. To prevent the window from closing immediately, a breakpoint should be placed on the last line of the program by clicking the mouse at the very beginning of the line containing the return command.\nIf a new folder is created for another program or programs, .vscode folder should be copied there and all the preparatory actions are done.\nThe basics of working with a debugger\nProgram behavior is easily monitored using debugger. To demonstrate how such a program works, we will replace the content of program.c with\n#include<stdio.h>\n\n4\tWriting and compiling programs in an integrated development environment\nKnowledge of elementary editing of a program by notepad or a similar text editor, compiling programs from the command line, and running programs from the command line, is mandatory and will be tested during laboratory exercises.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to make writing, compiling, and testing programs easier. In the Introduction to Programming course, we will use Visual Studio Code development environment, because it is an open source program, runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac), the installation package is relatively small compared to other similar environments, installation is fast and can be used for programming in any programming language, provided that a suitable compiler is installed on your computer, such as the MinGW package whose installation and use is described in the previous sections. The following assumes that MinGW is installed in accordance with the instructions in the previous sections.\nInstallation of the environment\nVisual Studio Code (VSC) is downloaded from the link\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/download\nAfter selecting the platform, downloading and running the installer and successfully completing the installation, VSC is ready to launch.\nThe VSC desktop treats a single folder within the file system as a project. Therefore, the first action to take is to open the folder in which the program files are or will be located, such as the folder where we tested the compiler gcc (File -> Open Folder...).\nThe VSC toolbar consists of the following icons:\nExplorer (work with files in the currently open folder)\nSearch (search for content in the currently open folder and subfolders)\nSource control (working with GIT version control system)\nDebug (running a program and troubleshooting a program)\nExtensions (installing a VSC extension)",

If program.c is changed, this file will become newer than program.o, wich results, due to the option -c (compile), in compilation into object code, which will make the object code newer than the executable one, causing linking.\nIt is important to know that the indentation of a command that is executed for an appropriate rule is mandatory, with a tab character, and that the line describing the dependency of the executable code on the object code must be written first.\nIn practice, there will also be dependencies on the object code file and header (.h) files that are included in the compilation by the preprocessor command #include.\nIf, for example, a program consists of two modules, p1.c i p2.c where the first includes h1.h i h2.h, and the second includes h3.h, this will be defined in the following Makefile:\nprogram.exe: p1.o p2.o\n\tgcc -o program.exe program.o\np1.o: p1.c h1.h h2.h\n\tgcc -c -g -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall p1.c\np2.o: p2.c h3.h\n\tgcc -c -g -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall p2.c\ntasks.json must now describe the call of program make. I can be done by replacing the gcc call with a make program call while deleting the argument list (make does not require arguments if dependencies are described in the file Makefile, otherwise the arguments at the call should be  -f name_of_make_file). Alternatively, in tasks.json a new task can be added as follows:\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [{\n            \"label\": \"Build with gcc\",\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\n            \"command\": \"gcc\",\n\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [{\n            \"label\": \"Build with gcc\",\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\n            \"command\": \"gcc\",\n            \"args\": [\"-g\", \"-std=c11\", \"-pedantic-errors\",\n                \"-Wall\", \"-o\", \"program.exe\", \"${file}\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"label\": \"Build with make\",\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\n            \"command\": \"make\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nIn any case, care should be taken that the option\"preLaunchTask\" in launch.json references the corresponding task, in this example like this:\n\"preLaunchTask\": \"Build with make\"",

It is envisaged that:\n    50 hours will be spent on attending classes,\n    20 hours will be spent participating in laboratory exercises and attending exams,\n    the remaining time, i.e. at least 140 hours, must be spent on independent work.\nIt should be noted that 140 hours, when distributed on all teaching weeks, equal to an average of approximately 10 hours of independent work per week. Due to the layered approach in the processing of materials, it is very important to work continuously, every week. Campaign work (e.g. \"I won\u2019t do anything for three weeks and then I\u2019ll make up for it all at once\") on this subject will almost certainly end in very poor results.\nIndependent work includes:\n    Learning\n        Slides from the lectures\n        Your own notes\n        Reading other literature (see chapter Recommended reading)\n        Internet\n    Solving tasks\n        solving a large number of tasks on your own computer acquires the necessary skills (simple algorithm design, code writing, translation, error detection, testing) which are tested in laboratory exercises and written tests (midterm, final exam, exam).\n        It is therefore of the utmost importance:\n        solve published assignments for exercises in addition to lectures (published at the same time as lectures)\n        test examples of programs and excerpts from lectures, modify these examples yourself, notice the effects of modifications (you can copy the program code of examples from lectures from PDF versions of published lectures)\n    Reading other literature (see chapter Other materials - Recommended reading)\n    Browsing content on the Internet for additional explanations and examples\n\nIntroduction to programming: A guide for students\n1\tIntroduction\nThe aim of the course is to adopt the basic concepts of programming and gain the ability to create less complex programs in the programming language C.\nLecture slides, instructions, recommended literature, official reminders, and other materials are published through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nAlso, in case of need, students will receive the notification by e-mail, therefore you should check your email inbox @fer.hr.\n\n\n2\tForms of teaching\n2.1\tLectures\nThe lectured present theoretical assumptions and explains concepts that are supported by numerous explanations and examples. There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\n2.4\tConsultations\nStudents have the opportunity to consult with the teacher.

There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter",

Click on the \"yellow tools\" icon  in the upper right corner of the question page\n\t2. Enter a description of the problem in the window that appears and confirm it by clicking Yes, raise ticket.

While waiting for an answer, the student is not able to send additional messages related to the same task (he can send messages about other tasks) - the icon turns red, and an hourglass icon appears next to it.\nAfter the the problem has been addresses, a message saying \"Ticket resolved\" appears on the student's screen.\n\t4.

Nothing may be added to the copies of official reminders that you will use in knowledge tests.\n    Official reminder for programming language C -\n        a very useful tool with information that teachers feel as unnecessary to memorize. It is recommended to use the official reminder both in lectures and during independent work, in order to get acquainted with where some information can be found, which facilitates the use of reminders in knowledge tests.\n        on a copy of the official reminder nothing should be added\n        this reminder will be available in digital form (pdf file) at the laboratory exercises in the Edgar system\n\n5.4\tLecturers\nLecturer\nProf. dr. sc.

Ing., melita.fertalj@fer.hr\nIf communicating via email, please start subject with [IPRO2023].\n\nIntroduction to programming: A guide for students\n1\tIntroduction\nThe aim of the course is to adopt the basic concepts of programming and gain the ability to create less complex programs in the programming language C.\nLecture slides, instructions, recommended literature, official reminders, and other materials are published through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nAlso, in case of need, students will receive the notification by e-mail, therefore you should check your email inbox @fer.hr.\n\n\n2\tForms of teaching\n2.1\tLectures\nThe lectured present theoretical assumptions and explains concepts that are supported by numerous explanations and examples. There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\nAfter the 10-minute period from the submission of the test, the review will be disabled, but the summary status of the test will still be displayed.\n\nAn overview of the summary results of all tests performed so far can be obtained at any time by selecting the option \u201eMy previous exams\u201c.\n\n\n3\tTicketing system\nIn order to facilitate communication between students and teaching staff during the writing of tests, Edgar offers a support system called Ticketing system. In case of doubt about the accuracy of the solution or something else, the student can ask a question related to a specific task.\nUsing the system while writing the test is described below.\n\t1. Click on the \"yellow tools\" icon  in the upper right corner of the question page\n\t2. Enter a description of the problem in the window that appears and confirm it by clicking Yes, raise ticket. Then continue with the test,  without waiting for an answer.\n\t3.The teaching staff will examine the problem as soon as possible and answer the student. While waiting for an answer, the student is not able to send additional messages related to the same task (he can send messages about other tasks) - the icon turns red, and an hourglass icon appears next to it.\nAfter the the problem has been addresses, a message saying \"Ticket resolved\" appears on the student's screen.\n\t4. The student can then return to the appropriate question and check for the answer. The answer can be viewed by clicking on the \"green cloud\" icon.
