Write your source code in a file with .c extension, for example, test.c.\n3. Save the file.\n4. Use the GCC compiler to translate the program into an executable file with the same name but different extension, for example, test.exe: gcc -o <output-file-name> <input-file-name>\n5. To execute the program, run the command in the terminal or command prompt: ./<output-file-name>\n6. If you want to execute the program with specific input values, use redirection operators (>) or pipes (|) to provide input from a file or output to a file. For example, if you have a file named input.txt containing numbers, you can run the command: ./<output-file-name> < input.txt > output.txt\n7. If you want to execute the program with specific options, use the -o option followed by the name of the executable file and the input file. For example: gcc -o <",

Therefore, \"Save\" should only be used if you have written program code and have not run it.\nIf an interrupt occurs, the test can later be re-accessed. By selecting the option \"Start exam (or continue ongoing exam)\" from the main menu, the system will display all tests that you have started but have not submitted, as well as the due time for the completion of the test (Available until). By entering the appropriate password, work on the interrupted test continues.\n\nInstructions for performing laboratory exercises and tests via the Edgar system\n\n\n1\tEdgar system \nThe Edgar system is used for automatic assessment of tests of theoretical and practical knowledge of the course Introduction to Programming. In this course, you will encounter programming tasks, where for a given problem it is necessary to write a program solution in the C programming language. \nThe labs contain program tasks that are solved and tested in the Notepad editor (++) or the VSC development environment, and the final solution is transferred (copy-paste) to the Edgar system.\nYou can access the Edgar system at:   https://edgar.fer.hr/\nNote: The layout of the graphical user interface elements on the current version of the system Edgar may differ in part from the appearance of the user interface shown in the illustrations later in this document. In case of any ambiguities and/or difficulties when using the system, contact the assistant on duty.\n\nIf the compilation of the program is successful, the program will be run on several pre-prepared test cases. If the printout of the program for a case does not correspond to the expected printout, a certain percentage, determined in advance for that case, is deducted from the total number of points provided for the task. This percentage can be 100% if it is a typical test case, for example if a program that determines whether a given number is within the required interval does not work well for numbers inside or outside the interval, or less than 100% if the test case examines program behavior at the boundaries of the interval. The total deducted percentage of points for a task cannot exceed 100%.\nThe process of writing tasks in the Edgar system will be illustrated by one of the tasks from the demo test, which reads:",

In the course Introduction to programming, for this purpose will use the C programming language.\nThe program, written in symbolic language and stored in a file with the extension .c, needs to be converted to commands understandable to the processor, or executable machine code (in Windows operating system, files with the extension .exe, in Unix / Linux operating systems, the format of the extension is not prescribed). The conversion process is carried out in two steps (the concept of preprocessing and assembly code creation will be omitted here because it is indivisible as part of translation):\n\nIntroduction to programming: A guide for students\n1\tIntroduction\nThe aim of the course is to adopt the basic concepts of programming and gain the ability to create less complex programs in the programming language C.\nLecture slides, instructions, recommended literature, official reminders, and other materials are published through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nAlso, in case of need, students will receive the notification by e-mail, therefore you should check your email inbox @fer.hr.\n\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to make writing, compiling, and testing programs easier. In the Introduction to Programming course, we will use Visual Studio Code development environment, because it is an open source program, runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac), the installation package is relatively small compared to other similar environments, installation is fast and can be used for programming in any programming language, provided that a suitable compiler is installed on your computer, such as the MinGW package whose installation and use is described in the previous sections.
