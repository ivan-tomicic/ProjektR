With knowledge of more advanced functionalities, the details of which we will not dwell into here, it is possible to write Makefile which can be used to compile programs of any complexity, without explicitly specifying individual components and their dependencies. Very superficially explained, all the files with the extension .c are source files for the program, and all the files with the extension .o are object code and are derived from the source code of the same base name. The compiler name and options are stored in variables CC and CFLAGS.\nCC = gcc\nCFLAGS=-c -g -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall\nSRCS=$(wildcard *.c)\nINCLUDES=$(wildcard *.h)\nOBJS=$(SRCS:.c=.o)\n\nmain.exe: $(OBJS)\n\t$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS)\n\n$(OBJS) : %.o: %.c $(INCLUDES)\n\t$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<\n\nclean:\n\tdel *.o *.exe\nThere last rule allows us to delete all object and executable code files. This, like any other single rule, can be executing by calling the program make specifying the name of the rule to be executed, in this example make clean. The first subsequent make program call will cause all the program modules to be compiled.\nFormatting the code\nProperly formatted code is a prerequisite for the readability of the program.

There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\n5\tOther materials\n5.1\tRecommended reading\n    V. Mornar: Introduction to programming, working version of the textbook\n        The textbook covers the complete material of the subject, and even more than that. The textbook will be available on MS Teams as pdf. An integral part of the textbook is the folder Examples with about ninety programs that can be independently translated and run in the command line or in the development environment VSCode.\n    K. N. King, C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition, W. W. Norton & Company\n        An extensive work (805 pages) that has been accepted as a textbook at hundreds of universities around the world.\n    B. W. Kernighan, D. M. Ritchie: The C Programming Language, Second Edition, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall\n        A basic book whose authors are the creators of the C programming language from which many generations of programmers have learned the language.\n5.2\tInstructions\n    Instructions for compiling programs written in the programming language C\n        contain a detailed description of the software installation procedures and how to compile and execute the program. Based on these instructions, students must learn to use some of the simple editors (Notepad or Notepad ++) and compile programs using the operating system command line. In addition, students can use these instructions, if they wish, to install and learn the basics of using the integrated development environment VSCode, which greatly facilitates error detection because it has a simple interaction with a specialized program - a debugger.\n    Instructions for using the character interface in Windows\n        basics of using the operating system's character interface (command line).
