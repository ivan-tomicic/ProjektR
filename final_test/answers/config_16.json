In this course, you will encounter programming tasks, where for a given problem it is necessary to write a program solution in the C programming language. \nThe labs contain program tasks that are solved and tested in the Notepad editor (++) or the VSC development environment, and the final solution is transferred (copy-paste) to the Edgar system.\nYou can access the Edgar system at:   https://edgar.fer.hr/\nNote: The layout of the graphical user interface elements on the current version of the system Edgar may differ in part from the appearance of the user interface shown in the illustrations later in this document. In case of any ambiguities and/or difficulties when using the system, contact the assistant on duty.\n\nIf the compilation of the program is successful, the program will be run on several pre-prepared test cases. If the printout of the program for a case does not correspond to the expected printout, a certain percentage, determined in advance for that case, is deducted from the total number of points provided for the task. This percentage can be 100% if it is a typical test case, for example if a program that determines whether a given number is within the required interval does not work well for numbers inside or outside the interval, or less than 100% if the test case examines program behavior at the boundaries of the interval. The total deducted percentage of points for a task cannot exceed 100%.\nThe process of writing tasks in the Edgar system will be illustrated by one of the tasks from the demo test, which reads:",

This includes learning from slides during lectures, taking your own notes, reading other literature (see chapter Recommended reading), solving tasks, testing examples of programs and excerpts from lectures, modifying these examples yourself, noticing the effects of modifications. You should also attend laboratory exercises and exams, and spend 50 hours on attending classes.

Therefore, \"Save\" should only be used if you have written program code and have not run it.\nIf an interrupt occurs, the test can later be re-accessed.
