In the course Introduction to programming, for this purpose will use the C programming language.\nThe program, written in symbolic language and stored in a file with the extension .c, needs to be converted to commands understandable to the processor, or executable machine code (in Windows operating system, files with the extension .exe, in Unix / Linux operating systems, the format of the extension is not prescribed). The conversion process is carried out in two steps (the concept of preprocessing and assembly code creation will be omitted here because it is indivisible as part of translation):\na)\tThe translation into object code is done by a program called the compiler. The compiler translates the source file and creates the object code file (usually with the extension .o) that cannot yet be run because it does not yet have links to functions and variables from other object code files and libraries where standard functions (input / output, mathematical functions, etc.) have been prepared.\nb)\tLinking to the executable code is done by a program called the linker. This program merges all the required object code files with the pre-programmed libraries and creates executable code that can be run directly from the operating system.\nAny text editor already installed on the computer can be used to prepare the source code (write the program). The editor must not create additional hidden formatting tags, such as done by Word. An example of such a program is the basic Notepad editor or the slightly improved Notepad++. The compiler and linker are often not part of the operating system and need to be installed.

Mornar: Introduction to programming, working version of the textbook\n        The textbook covers the complete material of the subject, and even more than that. The textbook will be available on MS Teams as pdf. An integral part of the textbook is the folder Examples with about ninety programs that can be independently translated and run in the command line or in the development environment VSCode.\n    K. N. King, C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition, W. W. Norton & Company\n        An extensive work (805 pages) that has been accepted as a textbook at hundreds of universities around the world.\n    B. W. Kernighan, D. M. Ritchie: The C Programming Language, Second Edition, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall\n        A basic book whose authors are the creators of the C programming language from which many generations of programmers have learned the language.\n5.2\tInstructions\n    Instructions for compiling programs written in the programming language C\n        contain a detailed description of the software installation procedures and how to compile and execute the program. Based on these instructions, students must learn to use some of the simple editors (Notepad or Notepad ++) and compile programs using the operating system command line. In addition, students can use these instructions, if they wish, to install and learn the basics of using the integrated development environment VSCode, which greatly facilitates error detection because it has a simple interaction with a specialized program - a debugger.\n    Instructions for using the character interface in Windows\n        basics of using the operating system's character interface (command line). Based on these instructions, students are expected to independently learn several operating system commands listed there: basics of positioning in file system folders, creating, renaming files and folders, redirecting inputs and outputs.\n\nNow all we have to do is open our source program file (because the configuration specifies that the program currently open in the editor is compiled) select Debug and start the program by pressing Start debugger or simply by pressing the key F5 on the keyboard.\nConsequently, the program will be compiled as described in prelaunch task in tasks.json and then, if compilation is successful, the program will be executed described in launch.json.\nIf the program has been modified in any way in the meantime, mark x after the program name will change into a circle and changes will need to be saved before the compilation with File/Save or Ctrl-S.\nThis action will print the text Introduction to Programming in a new window, which will then close immediately. To prevent the window from closing immediately, a breakpoint should be placed on the last line of the program by clicking the mouse at the very beginning of the line containing the return command.\nIf a new folder is created for another program or programs, .vscode folder should be copied there and all the preparatory actions are done.\nThe basics of working with a debugger\nProgram behavior is easily monitored using debugger. To demonstrate how such a program works, we will replace the content of program.c with\n#include<stdio.h>\n\n4\tWriting and compiling programs in an integrated development environment\nKnowledge of elementary editing of a program by notepad or a similar text editor, compiling programs from the command line, and running programs from the command line, is mandatory and will be tested during laboratory exercises.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to make writing, compiling, and testing programs easier.

For example, you can use a variable like CC to store the compiler name and options, and another variable CFLAGS for storing the compiler flags. You can also use wildcards to find all .c files (SRCS) and all .h files (INCLUDES). Then, create rules to compile source files into object code and link object code into an executable.

            "combined_documents": "Introduction to programming: A guide for students\n1\tIntroduction\nThe aim of the course is to adopt the basic concepts of programming and gain the ability to create less complex programs in the programming language C.\nLecture slides, instructions, recommended literature, official reminders, and other materials are published through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nAlso, in case of need, students will receive the notification by e-mail, therefore you should check your email inbox @fer.hr.\n\n\n2\tForms of teaching\n2.1\tLectures\nThe lectured present theoretical assumptions and explains concepts that are supported by numerous explanations and examples. There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter\n\n2.2\tIndependent work\nThe course is performed with a load of 7 ECTS credits, which means that the total student engagement required to successfully master the material is estimated at approximately 7 x 30 = 210 hours. It is envisaged that:\n    50 hours will be spent on attending classes,\n    20 hours will be spent participating in laboratory exercises and attending exams,\n    the remaining time, i.e. at least 140 hours, must be spent on independent work.\nIt should be noted that 140 hours, when distributed on all teaching weeks, equal to an average of approximately 10 hours of independent work per week. Due to the layered approach in the processing of materials, it is very important to work continuously, every week. Campaign work (e.g. \"I won\u2019t do anything for three weeks and then I\u2019ll make up for it all at once\") on this subject will almost certainly end in very poor results.\nIndependent work includes:\n    Learning\n        Slides from the lectures\n        Your own notes\n        Reading other literature (see chapter Recommended reading)\n        Internet\n    Solving tasks\n        solving a large number of tasks on your own computer acquires the necessary skills (simple algorithm design, code writing, translation, error detection, testing) which are tested in laboratory exercises and written tests (midterm, final exam, exam).\n        It is therefore of the utmost importance:\n        solve published assignments for exercises in addition to lectures (published at the same time as lectures)\n        test examples of programs and excerpts from lectures, modify these examples yourself, notice the effects of modifications (you can copy the program code of examples from lectures from PDF versions of published lectures)\n    Reading other literature (see chapter Other materials - Recommended reading)\n    Browsing content on the Internet for additional explanations and examples\n\n5.3\tOfficial reminder (cheat sheet)\nThe official reminder can be printed on the paper and used freely in lectures and any knowledge test: laboratory exercises, midterm exam, final exam and classical exams. Nothing may be added to the copies of official reminders that you will use in knowledge tests.\n    Official reminder for programming language C -\n        a very useful tool with information that teachers feel as unnecessary to memorize.

It will also be available in Edgar as a last question in the laboratory exercises and exams:\n\u2022\tCheat sheet for C\nKnowledge tests in laboratory exercises are accessed using a password. Knowledge tests are only available in a pre-set time intervals. \nThe system then asks the user to enter a password to access the exam. In the lab exercises, you will learn the passwords for the exams from the assistant on duty just before you start writing each exam.\n\nThe test is commenced by the option \u201eStart exam\u201c.\nTo practice working with the system at home, a demo test has been defined. This test is not graded and can be run an unlimited number of times. The password is not needed. The test is available under \u201cPublic exams\u201d. \n\nLinks at the top of the screen are used to navigate between tasks in the tests. In addition to the ordinal number of each task, the status of the task is shown in parentheses. Next to the ordinal number of the questions that have not yet been answered, a minus sign is displayed. If the answer to the question is a software solution that has already been written, it will be marked with </>.\n\nWith each task, information is shown regarding the points that the student earns for correct, unanswered and incorrect answer.\n\nIn the upper right corner there is a clock that counts down the time until the end of writing the test, a picture of the student and the \"Submit\" button which is used to submit the entire test for the final assessment (not individual tasks!).\n\nThe student is obliged to submit the test for assessment by the end of the countdown, but it will be possible to submit the test for assessment in a reasonable time after the expiration. This timeout, however, will be recorded in the system, so the test can be canceled later.\nIn the upper left corner (next to the test name) there is a button for selecting the layout of the screen.\n\nOnly if the print statement is corrected to \nprintf(\"%d %d\\n%d\", a, b, a + b);\n\nthe program will return the correct result for all test cases.\n\nIn the event of an unforeseen circumstance (eg power failure), Edgar allows the current contents of the solution field to be stored:\n\u2022\tExplicitly - the contents of the field can be explicitly saved by clicking the \"Save\" button in the upper right corner (below the \"Run\" button).\n\u2022\tImplicitly - Edgar automatically saves the contents of the field each time it is started with the \"Run\" option. Therefore, \"Save\" should only be used if you have written program code and have not run it.\nIf an interrupt occurs, the test can later be re-accessed. By selecting the option \"Start exam (or continue ongoing exam)\" from the main menu, the system will display all tests that you have started but have not submitted, as well as the due time for the completion of the test (Available until). By entering the appropriate password, work on the interrupted test continues.\n\n\n2.2\tCompletion of writing and submission of the test for assessment \nAfter completing all the tasks, the test should be submitted for the final assessment by selecting the \"Submit\" option in the upper right corner of the window. The submission is confirmed once again by selecting \"Yes, submit test!\", but can also be canceled by selecting \"No, continue writing\". Also, the screen will show your solutions to individual tasks, which should be visually inspected before final submission.\nThen it is necessary to wait for the completion of the evaluation.\n\nAfter the evaluation, the summary results of the test will be displayed. Within 10 minutes of submission, the system provides an overview of the assessment of individual tasks. The overview of individual tasks is accessed by selecting the option \u201eReview\u201c.\n\nAfter the 10-minute period from the submission of the test, the review will be disabled, but the summary status of the test will still be displayed.\n\nIntroduction to programming: A guide for students\n1\tIntroduction\nThe aim of the course is to adopt the basic concepts of programming and gain the ability to create less complex programs in the programming language C.\nLecture slides, instructions, recommended literature, official reminders, and other materials are published through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nAlso, in case of need, students will receive the notification by e-mail, therefore you should check your email inbox @fer.hr.\n\n\n2\tForms of teaching\n2.1\tLectures\nThe lectured present theoretical assumptions and explains concepts that are supported by numerous explanations and examples. There will be short tests given during most lectures which will count towards the final grade.\nLectures take place in two cycles. After the first cycle, midterm exams are held, and after the second\ncycle final exams.\n    lectures in the 1st cycle, October 2nd - November 15th, 2023.\n    lectures in the 2nd cycle, December 4th, 2023 - January 24th, 2024.\nDuring the lectures, the planned material is presented with the help of Powerpoint slides, solve tasks, discuss, conduct ad hoc surveys and knowledge tests which can be used by students to determine knowledge and self-assessment\n    slides that will be presented at lectures are available through the IPRO2023 team on the Microsoft Teams platform\n    the content of the slides, since they are published in advance, don\u2019t need to be copied, but it is advised to take your own notes during lectures\n    actively participate in lectures: solve tasks assigned during lectures, ask teacher for additional clarifications\n    just following lectures and/or reading presentations will certainly not be enough to pass the exam, so pay close attention to the content of the Independent work chapter",

In the course Introduction to programming, for this purpose will use the C programming language.\nThe program, written in symbolic language and stored in a file with the extension .c, needs to be converted to commands understandable to the processor, or executable machine code (in Windows operating system, files with the extension .exe, in Unix / Linux operating systems, the format of the extension is not prescribed). The conversion process is carried out in two steps (the concept of preprocessing and assembly code creation will be omitted here because it is indivisible as part of translation):\na)\tThe translation into object code is done by a program called the compiler. The compiler translates the source file and creates the object code file (usually with the extension .o) that cannot yet be run because it does not yet have links to functions and variables from other object code files and libraries where standard functions (input / output, mathematical functions, etc.) have been prepared.\nb)\tLinking to the executable code is done by a program called the linker. This program merges all the required object code files with the pre-programmed libraries and creates executable code that can be run directly from the operating system.\nAny text editor already installed on the computer can be used to prepare the source code (write the program). The editor must not create additional hidden formatting tags, such as done by Word. An example of such a program is the basic Notepad editor or the slightly improved Notepad++. The compiler and linker are often not part of the operating system and need to be installed. For the purpose of Introduction to programming, ww will install MinGW packages in 32-bit version (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW).",

Here are some options: \nWindows 10: \na) Start  \u00ae\u00a0Type Command \u00ae the menu appears \u00ae select Command Prompt:\n                         \nOlder versions of Windows:\na) \tStart \u00ae\u00a0 All Programs \u00ae\u00a0 Accessories\u00ae\u00a0 Command Prompt\nb) \tStart \u00ae\u00a0 All Programs \u00ae\u00a0 Accessories \u00ae\u00a0 Run\nafter which the window displayed below opens in which it is necessary to enter the cmd command in the box and press the OK button: \n\n\nc) \tStart \u00ae\u00a0type cmd in the search box, after which the window shown under b) will open \nd) \tsimultaneous pressing of the Windows and R keys (Win + R), after which the window shown under b) opens\nIn all versions of Windows, the command prompt window then opens:\n\nInstructions for compiling programs written in programming language C\n\n1\tIntroduction\nElectronic computer programs are prepared in a symbolic, human-understandable programming language. In the course Introduction to programming, for this purpose will use the C programming language.\nThe program, written in symbolic language and stored in a file with the extension .c, needs to be converted to commands understandable to the processor, or executable machine code (in Windows operating system, files with the extension .exe, in Unix / Linux operating systems, the format of the extension is not prescribed). The conversion process is carried out in two steps (the concept of preprocessing and assembly code creation will be omitted here because it is indivisible as part of translation):\na)\tThe translation into object code is done by a program called the compiler. The compiler translates the source file and creates the object code file (usually with the extension .o) that cannot yet be run because it does not yet have links to functions and variables from other object code files and libraries where standard functions (input / output, mathematical functions, etc.) have been prepared.\nb)\tLinking to the executable code is done by a program called the linker. This program merges all the required object code files with the pre-programmed libraries and creates executable code that can be run directly from the operating system.\nAny text editor already installed on the computer can be used to prepare the source code (write the program). The editor must not create additional hidden formatting tags, such as done by Word. An example of such a program is the basic Notepad editor or the slightly improved Notepad++. The compiler and linker are often not part of the operating system and need to be installed. For the purpose of Introduction to programming, ww will install MinGW packages in 32-bit version (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW).",
