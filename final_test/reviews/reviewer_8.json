There are four exercises in the 1st cycle (before the midterm exam) and four exercises in the 2nd cycle. Each laboratory exercise lasts approximately 110 minutes and must be completed by the student within the specified time frame. There is no compensation for laboratory exercises in case of absence.\nThe laboratory exercise consists of two parts: solving tasks with multiple choice questions, where a correct answer earns positive points, an incorrect answer earns negative points, and an unanswered question does not earn negative points; and creating one or more programs (algorithm design, coding, testing). In these assignments, there are no negative points.\nStudents work independently on the faculty computer under the supervision of teachers on duty. They have access to the same tools they use to solve tasks on their own computers: Notepad and Notepad++ editors, gcc compiler used via the command line of the operating system, VSCode development environment.\nLaboratory exercises are submitted for assessment using the Edgar system.",
